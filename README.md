### What is this? Who am I?

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm 17, live in Poland and study computer science at school. I'm not gonna base my entire personality around it, but you have to tell something, right?

As you might've already guessed, one of my main interests is programming. Don't expect much, but at least I understand the basic stack everyone starts with, that is **HTML**+**CSS**+**JavaScript** (as well as **TypeScript**). Recently, I've been getting into **C#**, and as for now, I really like the experience and possibilities it provides. As for the DBs, everyone and their dog nowadays knows **MySQL**, and I'm no exception. 

For now, that's all I could think of. You may visit [this](https://sokzkomucha.xyz) for more, although the website has been "under maintenance" (fancy term for being lazy) for a long time.
