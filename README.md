### What is this? Who am I?

This is my GitHub profile. I'm 16, I live in Poland and study programming at school. As you probably already guessed, my main interest is programming. I understand **HTML** and **CSS** well, not to mention **Javascript**, and even some **Typescript**. Things I deal with include front-end and webservers written in **ExpressJS**. I haven't done much with databases, but I kinda already like **MongoDB**.
